    "text": "Fast fashion is a complicated industry that exploits many aspects of human life. In this project, I wish to dissect the Twitter discourse surrounding fast fashion to better understand the environmental, social, and cultural issues associated with the industry. I am specifically interested in how it is entangled with environmentalism, socioeconomic inequality, consumerism, human rights, and fashion culture. My research questions focus on examining how people discuss fast fashion on Twitter through qualitative and quantitative research, such as: 1. What is the discourse surrounding the advocacy and criticism concerning fast fashion? 2. How do American attitudes towards culture, capitalism, and environmentalism influence attitudes towards practices of fast fashion production and consumption?"

While the top 3 platforms/devices are very predictable, what is interesting is Post Studio and Hootsuite Inc. Given a simple Google search, I found out that these two platforms are essentially social media management platforms that have features such as auto posting. This tells that many companies and organizations such as news outlets are using these tools to share news or articles pertinent to fast fashion. This could mean that the Twitter discourse could be fairly neutral or evenly spread between each sentiment given that both individuals and organizations are present in the discussion.\n\n# making a line plot visualizing the number of tweets posted for each day from January 11, 2023, to February 3, 2023. \n\n# simplify the date to a \"Month/Date\" version for better interpretation and simplicity of the plot\ndate_simplified = []\nfor date in fashion[\"date\"]:\n    date_simplified.append(date[4:10])\nfashion[\"date_simplified\"] = date_simplified\n\ndate = fashion[\"date_simplified\"].unique()\ndate_1 = date[::-1]\n\n# count the number of tweets posted in each day\ncounts = fashion.groupby(\"date_simplified\").size()\n\n# create a line plot showcasing number of Tweets over time\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 6))\nax.plot(date_1, counts)\nax.set_xlabel('Date')\nax.set_ylabel('Counts')\nax.set_title('Number of Tweets over time')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nAccording to the graph, the highest peak in the number of tweets posted in a day is January 22, 2023 – January 23, 2023. Compared to the average of about 150 new tweets a day, January 22 saw 279 new tweets, and January 23 saw 254, which is about a 75% increase from the average. This could potentially show that something important happened in the area of fast fashion during this period which prompted people to share their original thoughts on Twitter. This can include new information or news being released such as a report detailing how much oil waste fast fashion companies produce. Such trends indicate how the discourse of fast fashion has changed over about a month by looking at catalyzing events.\n\n# making a pie plot visualizing the distribution of tweet types (organic tweets, replies, retweets)\n\n# I used the larger dataset for this visualization for a larger sample size\n# Calculating the counts of organic tweets, replies, and retweets respectively\nfashion_large = pd.read_csv(\"fastfashion_cleaned_full.csv\")\ncount_reply = 0\nfor i in fashion_large[\"inReplyToTweetId\"]:\n    if not math.isnan(i):\n        count_reply += 1\ncount_organic = 10025 - count_reply\ncount_retweet = fashion_large[\"retweetCount\"].sum()\ntweets_type = ['organic tweets', 'replies', 'retweets']\ntweets_type_counts = [count_organic, count_reply, count_retweet]\n\n# creating the pie plot showcasing relative proportions of tweet type\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.pie(tweets_type_counts, labels = tweets_type)\nplt.title('Tweet type distribution')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nMajority of the tweets are of the retweet type, whereas organic tweets and replies only constituted low percentages of the data. This suggests that the fast fashion topics are mostly resonating with people in the Twitter community and that they find it valuable enough to share. On the other hand, the low percentage of organic tweets and replies indicate a lack of original content that can spark conversations and engagement among the audiences. Much of the discourse surrounding fast fashion does not consist of individuals voicing their personal opinions.\nThis finding might provide insights to answer my research question on the dynamics of American attitudes toward the practices of fast fashion. High retweets typically indicate rising awareness, but there isn’t a lot of action being taken, and there are not enough people caring enough to take the time and express their own opinions. Moreover, the same narratives recirculating on Twitter may lead to unoriginal discourse and the spread of misinformation. This can happen in several ways, such as when users retweet or share the same posts without adding their own perspectives or insights or taking the original tweet out of context. Additionally, users may share the same articles, news stories, or opinion pieces, which can lead to a repetitive conversation on a particular topic in fast fashion. It can limit the diversity of perspectives and ideas that are being shared and the potential for new insights or creative solutions to be discovered.\n\n# count and order the frequency of hashtags, showing firt five \n\nfashion[\"hashtags\"].value_counts()[0:5]\n\n['fashion', 'women', 'men', 'beauty', 'model', 'design', 'art', 'Valentine', 'fallstores']    85\n['plussize', 'fashion', 'curves', 'curvy', 'style', 'inspo']                                  35\n['fashion', 'women', 'men', 'beauty', 'model', 'design', 'art', 'Christmas', 'fallstores']    22\n['streetwear', 'fashion']                                                                     14\n['fastfashion']                                                                               13\nName: hashtags, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n# making a pie plot of the top five frequent hashtags\n\nhashtag_type = ['[fashion, women, men,...Valentine]', '[plussize, fashion, curves,...]', '[fashion, women, men,...Christmas]',\n               '[streetwear, fashion]',  '[fastfashion]']\nhashtag_type_counts = [85, 35, 22, 14, 13]\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.pie(hashtag_type_counts, labels = hashtag_type)\nplt.title('Tweet hashtag distribution')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nBy looking at the most frequent hashtags, I observed that the most related topics to fast fashion turned out to be “Valentine,” “curves,” “streetwear,” “beauty,” etc.. This provides a clearer picture on how people view and reference to fast fashion, such that there are more references to fast fashion’s related festivals, styles, and customers than references to its environmental or ethical issues. However, hashtags cannot completely reflect the content of the tweets themself, since they only provide a convenient reference to certain topics. Therefore, in the next section, I will conduct more in-depth sentiment analysis on the raw content of tweets to obtain more insights."
